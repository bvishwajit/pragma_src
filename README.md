Big Data and ML
---------------
All my work is made available here. Mainly consisting of work I complete in Udacity Nanodegrees and other free courses from the same.
As of now the repository contains projects related to data science focused towards machine learning.

<h3>Update</h3>
I have decided to add projects that I do on other e-learning platforms such as udemy, coursera, etc and also projects that I contribute to as a free-lancer.
