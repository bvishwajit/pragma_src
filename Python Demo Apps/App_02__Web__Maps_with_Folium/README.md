        2.Demonstrates FeatureGroup by adding two feature groups to the map, namely fgv and
        fgp datatypes representing Volcanoes and Population respectively.

        3. fgv represents a set of geocoded locations on the map. They are given three colors
        depending on their elevation level.

        4. Countries are given three color based on their population. Green indicating a low dense population, yellow a medium one and a red color indicating heavily densed country.

        5. The map has two layers which can be turned on and off. We can just keep one of the layers, i.e. fgv or fgp on or off.
