Python Demo Apps - Demonstrating the Applications of Python
--------
Except app 1 most of the applications need third party libraries.
Please check the app folders for README.md files and read them
carefuly for instructions to run the apps on your system if  you
are new to programming. Rules are simple. I simply mention
the required libraries in the begining of every README.md file.

Its always a good idea to check if your system has the libraries by
using the **pip list** command. 
If the library is not available then use command **pip install <library-name>** 
without the brackets off-course.
