Machine Learning and AI
-------------------------
This repository contains projects, mini-projects and notes gathered while working on certifications, freelance projects and participating on competitive sites like Kaggle and/or TopCoder. I hope it helps other learners and professionals in some way. Any feedback is appreciated. Just drop an email to dataviz505@gmail.com.

As of now the repository contains projects related to data science focused towards machine learning.

Update
--------------------
Whatever I am trying to do is obviously connected with AI in one way or the other.
Its a deep subject matter and there are many open problems. I will keep updating this 
README.md whenever required.
